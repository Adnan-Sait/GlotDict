# Update times and release

When the developer of the extension think that a new release is ready and tested they create a new release and publish on Firefox and Chrome addons store.  
After that step we have to wait few hours for Chrome and for Firefox and all the installations will be updated automatically.

# Add a new glossary for a non-developer

Your glossary need to be published on GlotPress (and also on https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/) and a ticket created on https://github.com/Mte90/GlotDictJSON to update the internal system.
